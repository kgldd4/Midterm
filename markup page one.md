I was born in Kansas City, Missouri but did not live there long. I moved to Japan when I was little, and lived on the island of Okinawa for 3 years.

After moving back to America, my dad settled in St. Louis, and that is where I grew up. My dad chose St. Louis because that is where his family was. I actually graduated from the same Highschool that my father graduated from *[**Parkway North High School**](the next page) _Go Vikings!!!_
