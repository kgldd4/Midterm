## Thinking of the Future 

The more I think about it, the more I am **NOT** sure what I want to do in the future, of course I am getting my degree in environmental science, but I am getting less and less sure on what the next steps should be. Do I continue on my path and go to law school, or grad school, or do I find a job after getting this degree? 

Some factors in my decision are: 

* Location 
* money
* Friends and Family 
* Job Market/ Availability

I would love to eventually move somewhere outside of Missouri, and I think that the Pacific Northwest would be perfect for me. ![Picture of the Seattle Skyline](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/seattle-cityscape-with-mt-rainier-in-the-background-at-sunset-usa-picture-id1251467683?k=20&m=1251467683&s=612x612&w=0&h=NO8occAjS379H1tUXkyNzjbAtYekvqVJ6f5HKRw1ayw=)
