### The Highschool Years

As you know, I went to Parkway North High School. Parkway North is in Creve Coeur, Missouri. I actually was in the parkway school district my entire life. Starting from elementary school at McKelvey elementary, then middle at Northeast Middle School, then finally high school. I was a good student and was fairly involved in Highschool.
